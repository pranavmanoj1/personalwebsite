# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and How to Implement It

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on static training data, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant information from a specialized knowledge base before generating a response. This approach helps address two major limitations of LLMs:

1. **Stale Knowledge**: Since LLMs are trained on fixed datasets, they cannot incorporate new information post-training.
2. **Limited Niche Knowledge**: LLMs may not be well-versed in specific domains due to the lack of relevant data in their training corpus.

## How RAG Works

RAG consists of two primary components:

- **Retriever**: Fetches relevant context from an external database or knowledge base based on the user's query.
- **Generator**: Uses the retrieved context to generate a more informed and accurate response.

The process follows these steps:

1. **User Query** → Sent to the RAG module.
2. **Retriever Component** → Searches a vector database for relevant documents using text embeddings.
3. **Context Retrieval** → Retrieves the most relevant pieces of information.
4. **LLM Processing** → Augments the retrieved context into the prompt.
5. **Response Generation** → The LLM produces a response based on both its internal knowledge and the retrieved information.

## Brief Implementation in Python

To implement a simple RAG system using LangChain and a vector database like ChromaDB, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install langchain chromadb openai
```

### 2. Load Documents and Create Embeddings
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

# Load documents
loader = TextLoader("knowledge_base.txt")
documents = loader.load()

# Split text into chunks
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create embeddings and store in ChromaDB
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
```

### 3. Implement the RAG Pipeline
```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize Retriever
retriever = vector_db.as_retriever()

# Create LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
rag_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4"),
    retriever=retriever
)
```

### 4. Query the RAG System
```python
query = this is my query
response = rag_chain.run(query)
print(response)
```
