# How to Make a Chess Engine: Trying to understand how a chess engine works

I love playing chess. It got me wondering, how would I go about creating a chess engine?  This guide will walk you through the key steps involved in creating a chess engine.

## 1. Representing the Chessboard

The first step in building a chess engine is deciding how to represent the chessboard programmatically. One of the most efficient methods is the **bitboard** representation.

### Bitboards
A **bitboard** utilizes a 64-bit integer, where each bit corresponds to a square on the chessboard. This means that a single bitboard can represent the position of all pieces of a particular type for one player. For example:
- One bitboard can represent all white pawns.
- Another bitboard can represent all black bishops.

Using bitwise operations, the engine can quickly check for occupied squares and legal moves, making move generation very efficient. (try guessing the operations)

## 2. Move Generation

A chess engine must generate all possible legal moves in a given position. This involves:
- Identifying which pieces can move.
- Determining the squares they can move to based on chess rules.
- Checking for special moves like castling and en passant.
- Ensuring that moves do not leave the king in check.

Efficient move generation is crucial since the engine will analyze millions of positions per second.

## 3. Evaluating a Position

To decide which move to play, the engine must evaluate the position. The simplest evaluation function considers **material advantage**, assigning numerical values to pieces:
- Pawn = 1
- Knight = 3
- Bishop = 3
- Rook = 5
- Queen = 9

A more advanced evaluation function takes into account **piece positioning**. For example:
- A knight in the center of the board is more valuable than one on the edge.
- The king is safer when castled.
- Control of the center is advantageous.

The evaluation function assigns a score to each position, where a higher score favors white and a lower score favors black.

## 4. Searching for the Best Move

Once move generation and evaluation are set up, the engine needs a method to search for the best move. This is done using **tree search algorithms**, such as:

### Minimax Algorithm
Minimax is a recursive algorithm where:
- The engine generates all possible moves.
- It evaluates the resulting positions.
- It assumes the opponent will always play the best possible counter-move.
- The best move for the current player is chosen based on the evaluations.

For example, if white is to move, minimax selects the move that maximizes the evaluation. Conversely, black aims to minimize the evaluation.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Minimax can be slow because it evaluates every possible move. **Alpha-beta pruning** optimizes this process by eliminating unnecessary calculations:
- If a position is already known to be worse than a previously evaluated position, it is discarded.
- This dramatically reduces the number of positions the engine has to analyze, improving efficiency.

## 5. Optimizations

To improve the engine's performance, additional optimizations can be implemented:
- **Transposition Tables**: Store previously computed positions to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Move Ordering**: Prioritize promising moves first (e.g., capturing high-value pieces or checks).
- **Quiescence Search**: Prevents premature evaluation by continuing the search in tactical positions (e.g., captures and checks).
- **Opening Books & Endgame Tables**: Use precomputed databases for known opening and endgame positions.

## 6. Implementation and Testing

Once the core engine is built, it should be tested against:
- **Other chess engines** to benchmark strength.
- **Human players** to ensure realistic play.
- **Standard test suites** (e.g., the perft function for move generation validation).

Debugging and iterating on the engineâ€™s logic will refine its strength and efficiency.
